### Week Q2.2
- Jeroen: https://github.com/doda25-team19/lib-version/pull/2
This week I worked on A1/F2 Library Release. A workflow is used to automatically package and version lib-version and to release it in the GitHub package registry for Maven.

 - Miroslav: https://github.com/doda25-team19/operation/pull/1
For this week I worked on A1/F7 - docker compose. I built and pushed the images for the 2 containers, created the .yml compose file and .env file for the variables.

- Arda: https://github.com/doda25-team19/lib-version/pull/1
This week I worked on A1/F1 Version-aware Library. I implemented the VersionUtil class and configured Maven resource filtering to inject the version directly from the pom.xml metadata.
