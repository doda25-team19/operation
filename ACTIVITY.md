Meet with the group at the lab. 

### Week Q2.2
- Jeroen: https://github.com/doda25-team19/lib-version/pull/2
This week I worked on A1/F2 Library Release. A workflow is used to automatically package and version lib-version and to release it in the GitHub package registry for Maven.

 - Miroslav: https://github.com/doda25-team19/operation/pull/1
For this week I worked on A1/F7 - docker compose. I built and pushed the images for the 2 containers, created the .yml compose file and .env file for the variables.

- Arda: https://github.com/doda25-team19/lib-version/pull/1
This week I worked on A1/F1 Version-aware Library. I implemented the VersionUtil class and configured Maven resource filtering to inject the version directly from the pom.xml metadata.

- Benas: https://github.com/doda25-team19/app/pull/3 https://github.com/doda25-team19/model-service/pull/1
This week I worked on A1/F6 Flexible Containers. I made it possible to define the port on which the app and the model-service run through an ENV variable.

- Mikolaj: This week I worked on A1/F8 – Automated container image releases. 
I prepared the initial draft of the workflow for releasing the container images. Due to a family emergency, I wasn’t able to complete the implementation yet. The team is aware, and we agreed that I will finalize and commit it at the beginning of Q2.3.
